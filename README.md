# CADemy - Making 3D design education free, fun and accessible for everyone.

CADemy is an interactive web-based application designed to teach 3D modeling and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) concepts through hands-on practice and progressive challenges.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Environment**: Work with real 3D objects using professional-grade tools
- **Progressive Learning**: Start with basic shapes and advance to complex assemblies
- **Challenge-based Learning**: Learn through practical challenges that simulate real-world tasks
- **Transform Controls**: Move, rotate, and scale objects with precision

## Technology Stack

- **React** - User interface and component management
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics and rendering
- **React Three Fiber** - React renderer for Three.js
- **React Three Drei** - Useful helpers for React Three Fiber
- **Tailwind CSS** - Responsive and modern styling
- **Webpack** - Module bundling and development server
